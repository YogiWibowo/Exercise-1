<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hello! My name is Yogi Wibowo. I have been living in "rain city" since 1993. I totally love this city in my deepest heart. A lot of stories have
    been come through in my live. I still remember most the memories either pleasant or not. When I recall those things, I would like to keep to be 
    grateful to God for all these things. It must be difficult to hold my tears not to go down but I let it go out because this remind me for my wonderful times.
    We know all these things are something which you could not buy. 
</p>
<p>
    I had been in Jakarta before I moved to Bogor in 1993. I was so angry then because I had to leave our house where I spent my time with my family and 
    friends to a place where it was so quiet and did not have many neighboors, at least that was my assumption. But the reality is so different, I enjoy
    serenity here. 
</p>
<p>
I studied at SDN Tonjong 2 from 1994 to 2000. I have pleasant memories for that time because most people could not have gadget so then my friends and I
used to go out playing many things like outdoor activities. I hope my son will ever be able to play such as things because it will be difficult to find 
the situation in recent days. I am so grateful to be born by the end of 90's so then I could enjoy the wonderful things.
</p>
<p>
  In 2000 I studied at SLTPN 5 Bogor. I felt different situation during my junior high school time because I was in a different place where this was
  the first time I had to get far away from my house. That was my first adolescence so then I felt times when I used to play with my friends until I 
  forgot to study seriously. I was crazy playing badminton at that time and joined some tournaments. 
</p>
<p>
After graduating from junior high school in 2003, I continued my senior high school at SMUN 5 Bogor where I was serious and had positive environment to
study. This was a place where I tried to chase my goal and got excited in studying. At the end of my last year I was successful to enter my college
which was STT TELKOM.
